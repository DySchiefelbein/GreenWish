# Frontend Developer Test

## Challenges

### Photo album

Use:

1. ReactJS or Angular
2. Your favourite tools for state management, UI framework and HTTP requests
3. JSON Placeholder (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide/) as a data source

Implement a photo album which reads the items from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums/1/photos

Render the photos in a 12 column grid for desktop or 2 column on Mobile devices (you choose the breakpoint or rely on your framework)

When a photo is clicked, change view to display just that image filling the browser window, and allow the user to swipe between images (or click a corresponding arrow)

When a user is on a single photo and copies the browser url, sharing it with another user, the second user should see the same photo as the first.

## Tips

- Automated tests are fundamental to successful software projects (optional)
- Using libraries, frameworks, and copied examples is fine, but you will be expected to explain your choices. So if in doubt, it may for example, be better to use your own implementation than using a library you do not fully understand.
- Code style (e.g. lint) and other checks are up to you
