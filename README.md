# Photo album

## Possible features

- placeholder for loading the images
- add date to api for visible sorting with date
- load only a part and reload new ones after reaching the end of the screen

## Should be improved

- Higher thumbnail resolution for mobile devices, due to 2-column grid (minimum: 350px * 350px)

## Heroku

To test the app for productive I have created an app on Heroku. It can be accessed at [https://photo-album-greenwish.herokuapp.com/](https://photo-album-greenwish.herokuapp.com/). The first time the app is opened, it may take a few seconds if it has not been used for some time.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
